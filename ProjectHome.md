Tuga Turtle is a simple turtle graphics programming system I designed for my son. It uses the Ruby programming language which can be expressed in simple forms. On the plus side, Ruby is also a language used professionally for web programming and in many other fashions.

Here's an example of a simple program that draws a green square:

```
color green
4.times do
	turn right
	walk 500
end
```

Tuga Turtle can be launched as a Java Web Start application, but it uses local storage in files, so it needs user permissions.
